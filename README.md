# JavaScript Basics: Function Expressions


## What Are Function Expressions?


Function expressions allow us to define functions and assign them to variables in JavaScript. This approach provides a flexible way to create and use functions, enabling more dynamic programming patterns and code reusability.

## Scope in Functions


Every function in JavaScript has its own scope, meaning variables defined inside a function are only accessible within that function. This helps in managing data privacy and reducing the risk of variable naming conflicts.

## Returning Values


One of the powerful features of functions is their ability to return values. This allows the output of a function to be captured and utilized, facilitating the creation of modular and maintainable code.
## Practical Uses of Function Expressions
Function expressions are incredibly versatile, useful for a wide range of tasks from data processing to dynamic content generation. Assigning functions to variables allows us to organize our code more effectively, making it easier to understand and maintain.
